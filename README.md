# Munamii

<h1>Munamii - Mini project</h1>
This is a mini project for a developer course.

<h2>What I have done</h2>
I have (according to instructions) kept it simple.

I have copied pictures and colours etc from internet.

I have implemented all with HTML and CSS (no JavaScript) - as requested.

I have learned a lot about:
<ul>
<li>CSS IMG positioning, sizing etc
<li>Using Google fonts
<li>Manipulating elements by transforming and such
<li>Shadows and borders

</ul>



<h2>Task</h2>

<h3>Specifications requested by the client</h3>
<ul>
<li>The site must work on phones and also computers.

<li>The Product page must be divided into Cupcakes and Wedding cakes.
<li>There must be at least 8 Cupcakes on the Product page.
<li>There must be at least 8 Wedding cakes on the Product page.

</ul>

<h3>Optional tasks</h3>
These are extra task and is not required to complete the project.
<ol>
<li>The client wants a contact form that sends a email (redacted).
<li>The client wants her users subscribing to a email list, so is requesting to create a section in the Home page or inside the footer.
</ol>

<h2>Hints for the project</h2>
<ol>
<li>You can use any logotype for the project or use the official one.
<li>You can use her color scheme or invent one using https://coolors.co
<li>You can use any cupcake or bakery social media accounts for the links in the footer. In case you want to use the official ones these are the links: Instagram and Facebook.
<li>For the text information on the webpage you can pick one of the 2 options:
<ol>
<li>Copy it any other bakery website.
<li>Use the information in the annex on the last page of this document. (Google translated from Spanish, feel free to correct any grammar mistakes)
</ol>
<li>For the products, you can browse her instagram account for pictures or search any from unplash.com. For the title and prices just write anything.
<li>Use Google Fonts to obtain nice fonts.
<li>Don’t use emojis. They work for instagram post and nerdy HTLM exercises but they don’t professional on a website.
<li>For the extra tasks, you can look at how to integrate readily to use solutions like the ones provided in MailChimp (free, but requires creating an account)
</ol>

You don’t need to implement a hamburger menu button. (3 lines icon) Because they either need JavaScript or more practice CSS for more hours you currently have.
For this project you can get by putting the menu links like the picture above. You can choose any other way to display the links.
